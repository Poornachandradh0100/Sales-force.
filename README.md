Certainly! Here's an explanation of the HTML code in plain words:

Document Type Declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>): This line tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.

HTML Element (<html lang="en">): This is the root element of the HTML document, and it specifies the language of the document (English).

Head Section (<head>): This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.

Meta Tags: These tags provide metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding (<meta charset="UTF-8">) and viewport settings (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">).

Page Title (<title>): This tag specifies the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser tab.

External Stylesheet Link (<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">): This line links an external CSS file (styles.css) to style the HTML document.

Body Section (<body>): This section contains the visible content of the HTML document, including text, images, and other elements.

Divisions (<div>): These are container elements used to group and style content within the webpage.

Header Section (<div id="header">): This section contains the header of the webpage, including the logo, navigation links, contact details, icons, login button, and a "Try for Free" button.

Content Sections: There are two main content sections (<div id="page1"> and <div id="page2">) divided into subsections (<div>) containing text, images, and other elements.

Text Elements (<h1>, <p>, <h3>, <h4>, <u>, <b>, <i>) and Images (<img>): These tags are used to display headings, paragraphs, and other text, as well as images, on the webpage.

Icons: Icons are displayed using the <i> tag with appropriate classes for styling.

Google Maps Embed (<iframe>): This tag embeds a Google Maps location map within the webpage.

Closing Tags (</...>): These tags close the corresponding opening tags to ensure proper HTML structure.

Overall, this HTML code creates a structured webpage layout with header, content sections, and footer, containing various elements like text, images, icons, and links.

Certainly! Let's break down the CSS code into language explanations:

Universal Selector (*{...}): This section sets the default margin and padding of all elements to 0, ensuring consistent spacing throughout the page. It also sets the box-sizing property to border-box, which includes padding and border in the element's total width and height calculation. Additionally, it specifies a list of fallback fonts in case the preferred fonts are not available.

html, body: These rules define the width and height of the entire webpage (html and body elements) to take up 100% of the viewport, ensuring that the webpage fills the entire browser window.

#main: This rule sets the width and height of the main container to 100%, ensuring it fills the entire viewport.

#header: This section styles the header of the webpage. It sets its width to 100%, height to 13% of the viewport, and fixes its position at the top of the page using position: fixed. The content of the header is arranged horizontally with space around using display: flex. The background color is set to white.

#logo: Styles the logo container, making it 70% of the height of its parent container (#header). It ensures that the logo image inside it fills the container without distortion (object-fit: cover).

.texts: This rule styles text elements within the header. It sets the color to dark blue and changes the color to light blue when hovered over.

#ContactDetails: This rule styles the contact details section within the header, adding left margin and a lighter font weight.

.icon: Styles icon elements by adding padding and border-radius, and changing the background color to light blue when hovered over.

#login: Styles the login section with padding, border-radius, and a light blue background color. It also changes the border color and background color when hovered over.

#try: This rule styles the "Try for Free" button with a green background, white text color, and darker green background color when hovered over.

Each CSS rule targets specific elements or groups of elements in the HTML document and defines their appearance, layout, and behavior on the webpage..
